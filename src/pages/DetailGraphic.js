            I wanted to have an Eye-Catching starting point for this website, so
            I tried out different illustration styles until I selected the curly
            girl.

            During my time in Cape Town some fellow designers and me started
            talking to a group of homeless people to find about their daily life
            and their every day problems as part of a design research project.
            Our goal was to find social design solutions to help their problems.
            One of their main issues was how they were seen by the people living
            and working in the buildings around them. So we decided to introduce
            these lovely people via postcards to their community. We also
            organized a Claim-your-streets-event to bring together the people
            living in these part of town no matter if they have a roof over
            their head or not.
